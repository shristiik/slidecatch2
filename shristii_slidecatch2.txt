Pseudocode:
Initialization and Setup:
Initialize pygame
Create a Game class subclassing sg.Scene

Create a Coin class subclassing sg.Sprite
    - Initialize Coin with scene reference
    - Define reset method to randomize coin position and speed

Create a Spaceship class subclassing sg.Sprite
    - Initialize Spaceship with scene reference
    - Define process method to handle spaceship movement

Create LblScore and LblTime classes subclassing sg.Label

Create an Instructions class subclassing sg.Scene
    - Initialize Instructions with score parameter
    - Display instructions, previous score, and buttons for play and quit

In the main function:
    Initialize pygame
    Initialize a score variable to 0
Game Loop:
While keepGoing is True:
    Instantiate Instructions scene with score
    Start Instructions scene

    If response from Instructions is "Play":
        Instantiate Game scene
        Start Game scene
        Update score with Game's score

    If response from Instructions is "Quit":
        Set keepGoing to False
Game Scene Functionality:
In the Game class:
    Initialize scene with background image, timer, score, and sound effect

    Initialize Spaceship sprite and Coin sprites
    Add sprites to scene sprites list

    While game is running:
        Process user input to move Spaceship
        For each coin in coins:
            Check collision with Spaceship
            If collision:
                Play sound effect
                Reset coin position
                Increment score
                Update score label

        Update time left label with timer's value
        If time left is 0:
            Print final score
            Stop scene
Instructions Scene Functionality:
In the Instructions class:
    Initialize scene with background image, instructions, score label, and buttons

    While scene is active:
        Check button clicks
        If Play button clicked or UP key pressed:
            Set response to "Play"
            Stop scene
        If Quit button clicked or DOWN key pressed:
            Set response to "Quit"
            Stop scene
